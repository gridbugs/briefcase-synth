# Oscillator

- There's a small amount of interaction between the PWM dial and PWM
  CV limit due to current flowing between the two potentiometers. This
  can be reduced (but never eliminated completely) by using a larger
  resistor between each potentiometer and the op-amp. Experiment with
  larger resistor values here next time.
